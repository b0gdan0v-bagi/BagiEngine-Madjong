# Build, format and include facts of this repository

Read by the skills `build`, `clang-format` and `strip-pch-includes`. The three skills are symlinks into `engine/.claude/skills/` (the same text as in the engine repository); what differs between the repositories is here. This file has the same headings and fields as `engine/.claude/rules/build-project.md`, its template. The todo areas are in `todo-project.md`, not here.

## Terms

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `<engine>` | `engine`: the folder with `CI/`, `cmake/` and `.venv`, the git submodule of this game. The same term as in `todo-loop` ("Areas and the repository rules"). |
| `<R>` | the repository to build or format. `.` by default (this repository). `engine` only for engine work done from this checkout; then the skills run from `engine/` and read `engine/.claude/rules/build-project.md`, so `<engine>` is `.` there. Every path below is relative to `<R>`. |
| `<product>` | the game executable of `<R>`, from the field `Product`. |
| `<tests>` | the test targets of `<R>`, from the field `Tests`. |
| `<py>` | the Python interpreter that runs `engine/CI/scripts/*.py`, from the field `Python` (below). |
| `<p>` | the preset the skill picked. |

## Build

Fields the `build` skill reads. The presets are the engine's (`CMakePresets.json` includes `engine/CMakePresets.json`); each builds into its own `build/<p>/`.

| Field | Meaning | Value here |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Product | the executable (target name; the file is `build/{Clang\|MSVC}{macOS\|Windows}/<name>[.exe]`) | `BagiMahjong` |
| Tests | the gtest targets; the argument `tests` builds exactly these (`--target <tests>`) | `MahjongTests` |
| Default build | what `cmake --build --preset <p>` with no `--target` builds | every target: `BagiMahjong` and `MahjongTests` |
| Source paths | the paths of `git status --porcelain -- <paths>` (a configure trigger) and of the `BE_CLASS` / `BE_EVENT` / `BE_REFLECT_FIELD` search | `src tests` |
| Extra configure triggers | cases besides the common ones (below) that need `cmake --preset <p>` | the submodule pointer `engine` moved (`git status --porcelain -- engine`, or `git diff HEAD -- engine`) |
| Extra failure hints | cause and fix for a configure, compile or link failure that is specific to this repository | see "Failure hints" |
| Extra gotchas | facts about the output, the tests or the run that hold only here | see "Gotchas" |
| Test run | what `ctest --preset <p>` runs here and what it needs | see "Tests" |
| Local overrides, editor | where per-machine settings and the IDE setup are described | below, "Local overrides" and "VS Code" |

The common configure triggers (the skill states them; this repository adds the one above): no `build/<p>/CMakeCache.txt`, the argument `configure`, added, deleted, renamed or untracked files under the source paths (sources are globbed without `CONFIGURE_DEPENDS`), a change in `CMakePresets.json`, `CMakeUserPresets.json` or any `*.cmake`, and a changed or new file under the source paths that contains `BE_CLASS`, `BE_EVENT` or `BE_REFLECT_FIELD` (reflection code is generated only at configure time).

### Failure hints

- A missing `engine/external/*` (the submodule is not initialised): `git -C engine submodule update --init`.
- A missing `jinja2` (the reflection generator): `CI/setup_venv.*` creates `engine/.venv`; `engine/.venv/bin` must be on `PATH` for `cmake --preset` (`export PATH="$PWD/engine/.venv/bin:$PATH"`, as the README does).
- `glslc not found`: install the Vulkan SDK or set `VULKAN_SDK` in `CMakeUserPresets.json` (see "Local overrides").

### Gotchas

- The engine is another repository: a build never edits `engine/`. A missing engine feature is `needs engine change`, not a patch here.
- Executables land in `build/{Clang|MSVC}{macOS|Windows}/BagiMahjong[.exe]` and `MahjongTests`, not in the preset folder; Debug and Release overwrite each other.
- `BagiMahjong` opens a window, so it is never started to check a build (to launch it use the `run` skill). `MahjongTests` opens none.

### Tests

`ctest --preset <p>` runs `MahjongTests` (the gtests, each in its own process) and `BagiMahjongControlSmoke` (`be_add_game_control_tests(BagiMahjong SCRIPT tests/control_smoke.py)` in `CMakeLists.txt`). The smoke test starts `BagiMahjong --headless --control` (no window) on a free port, once on the real clock and once with `--manual-clock`, and plays a hand and a match over WebSocket; it takes about 7 seconds. It does not build the executable: `cmake --build --preset <p> --target BagiMahjong MahjongTests` first (a missing executable is a skip, exit code 77). It runs by hand as `BAGI_ENGINE_DIR=engine python3 tests/control_smoke.py --exe build/ClangmacOS/BagiMahjong`.

### Local overrides

`CMakeUserPresets.json` (git-ignored) holds per-machine settings. It may inherit from the shared presets, but it needs its own build preset to appear in CMake Tools:

```json
{
    "version": 6,
    "configurePresets": [
        {
            "name": "macos-debug-ccache",
            "inherits": "macos-debug",
            "cacheVariables": {
                "CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER": "ccache",
                "VULKAN_SDK": "/Users/me/VulkanSDK/1.4.363.0/macOS"
            }
        }
    ],
    "buildPresets": [
        {
            "name": "macos-debug-ccache",
            "inherits": "macos-debug",
            "configurePreset": "macos-debug-ccache"
        }
    ]
}
```

`VULKAN_SDK` is only needed when `glslc` is not on PATH. `.claude/settings.local.json` is git-ignored and per machine too.

### VS Code

For explaining to the user. The workspace is `CI/BagiMahjong.code-workspace`: CMake Tools on the engine's presets (`cmake.useCMakePresets: always`), CodeLLDB / MSVC launch configurations and build tasks.

- **CMake: Select Configure Preset** and **CMake: Select Build Preset** pick the preset (also in the status bar).
- **CMake: Configure** / **CMake: Delete Cache and Reconfigure** are the configure step of the `build` skill. **Build** (F7) is the build step.
- F5 runs a debug configuration and builds first.

## Format

Fields the `clang-format` skill reads (the `strip-pch-includes` skill uses `Python` and `Format scope` too).

| Field | Meaning | Value here |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Python | the interpreter `<py>`. The two scripts use only the standard library, so no venv is needed; `uv run python` also works. A repository may name its venv interpreter instead | `python3` (Windows: `engine\.venv\Scripts\python`) |
| `<engine>` and `<R>` | the values of the two terms for the default run | `engine` and `.` (so `engine/CI/scripts/...` and `--root .`) |
| Format scope | the folders `--all` covers (also for `strip-pch-includes`) | `src/`, `config/`, `tests/` (`--all` covers `tests/` here) |
| Ignore file | the `.clang-format-ignore` in the root of `<R>`: required, one path or prefix per line, `#` comments, not merged with a default | the game's own: `engine/`, `build/`, `.venv/` |
| `--root` | never left out where it matters | **required**: without `--root .` the scripts format the engine |
| Launcher | whether a GUI runs the same scripts | none, see "Launcher" |

The commands, written with the values of this game (run from the repository root):

```bash
python3 engine/CI/scripts/format_sources.py --changed --root .
python3 engine/CI/scripts/format_sources.py --all --root .
```

For engine work done from this checkout (`<R>` = `engine`), run the engine's commands from `engine/` with the rules file of `engine/`.

`clang-format` lookup (the script prints the binary and the version it chose): `PATH`, `LIBCLANG_PATH`, `.venv` of `<R>` and of the engine, then on macOS Homebrew LLVM (keg-only, not on `PATH`) and Xcode. `--changed` skips untracked files (it reads `git diff --name-only HEAD`), so a new file is formatted by a direct call with `--style=file` (the `clang-format` skill shows the line). Homebrew LLVM goes on `PATH` for that one command only, never for `cmake --preset`. The todo-developer agent (step 5) uses the same commands.

## Strip PCH includes

Fields the `strip-pch-includes` skill reads (it shares `Python`, `Format scope` and the ignore file with "Format").

| Field | Meaning | Value here |
|-------|---------|------------|
| PCH | the header whose includes are dropped from sources; always the engine's, relative to `<engine>` | `engine/src/Modules/BECore/pch.h` (the script's default) |
| Strip example dir | a bounded folder of `<R>` for the dry run and the first real pass | `src/Mahjong/Game` |
| After a pass | what to build and run to validate the scope | `cmake --build --preset <p>` (the `build` skill), then build and run `MahjongTests` (`ctest --preset <p>`) |

The commands, written with the values of this game:

```bash
python3 engine/CI/scripts/strip_pch_includes.py --dry-run --changed --root .
python3 engine/CI/scripts/strip_pch_includes.py --dry-run --all --root . --dir src/Mahjong/Game
python3 engine/CI/scripts/strip_pch_includes.py --all --root . --dir src/Mahjong/Game
```

`--root .` is never left out: without it the script strips the engine's sources. The order stays: dry run, a bounded folder, the build and the tests, then a wider scope.

## Launcher

none. The engine launcher (`!start.cmd`, `!start.command`) is the engine repository's; this game has none.
